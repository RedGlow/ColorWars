General rules when adding new things:
	#if a new file is added, also add the proper licence (copy it from previous files)
	#new enumerators are added to the file "Enums.cs"
	#new GUIs or libraries should have the file "Logo.ico" as icon if appropriate
	#if some new code requires change when a new color is added, list it here and the exact position in the file itself

When adding a new colormodel, this is necessary:
	#derive the new color from the abstract class "Color"
	#add components with getter and setter (set range if possible) with "ColorValues" from the baseclass "Color"
	#add proper documentation to variables and methods
	#add information to this file
	#make the colormodel class sealed

When adding a new colormodel, you have to make changes to this files:	(closer description in files itself)
	#ColorManagment->Color_Conversion.cs
	#ColorManagment->Fast_Conversion.cs
	#ColorManagment->ICC_Conversion.cs	(if ICC compatible color)
	#ColorManagment->BaseColor.cs
	#ConversionGUI->MainForm.cs			(Not mandatory, but recommended)
	#PrecisionCompareGUI->MainForm.cs	(Not mandatory, but recommended)
	#SpeedGUI->MainForm.cs				(Not mandatory, but recommended)
	#ColorDifferenceGUI->MainForm.cs	(Not mandatory, but recommended)
